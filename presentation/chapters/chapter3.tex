\begin{frame}{Models}
    AE-MERF
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AE-MERF is based on the non-private version of DP-MERF (best state of the art generator for tabular data).
        \item Simple architecture with mathematically sophisticated loss function.
        \item Does not work with time series data out of the box, but we will modify it so it works.
    \end{itemize}
    RTSGAN
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model based on GAN network, which are commonly used in image generation.
        \item Delivers state of the art performance for time series data.
        \item No private counterpart, hence we will implement our own private version.
    \end{itemize}
