Hybrid approach [[[Split Learning]]] with half [[Homomorphic Encryption]] half synthetic data
- what is optimal ratio of HE to synthetic data / DP?

Optimal way of when to split in [[Split Learning for health]] to preserve accuracy and privacy
- How to quantify privacy?

DP + SD:
- Fix requirements on data and model!
- Paper from Apo

Challenges:
- privacy vs accuracy
- synthetic data generation for time series data
- anomaly detection on synthetic data
- robustness
- security
