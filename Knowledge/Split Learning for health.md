Authors are proposing different configurations for split learning for various health settings:
- **Simple vanilla configuration for SL**
- **U-shaped configuration without label sharing**
- **Vertical partitioned data for SL**

## Results
Comparision between [[Split Learning]]and [[Federated Learning]] and [[synchronous SGD]]:
- SL gets higher accuracies while using less computational resources and bandwidth
