- when playing with the model keep in mind the correlation between features in one timestep and across
- for timeGAN also test attention models
- we focus on Differential privacy
- topic: how to synthesise time series data with differential privacy for outlier detection?
	- synthetic data for time series data
	- differential privacy
	- outlier detection


- Roadmap:
1. set baseline model for time series data and anomaly detection
2. compare performance of synthesised data to baseline
3. add privacy
- not talking about federated learning or local fine tuning yet
