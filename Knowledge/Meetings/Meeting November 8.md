- stick to unsupervised anomaly detection approach
- maybe try out DP-MERF with time series just to see
- if utility is bad with DP:
	- weaken DP by training in adversarial manner, fix the adversary beforehand and train generator according to this 
- DP with time series might require a different DP variant
	- other variants of DP
