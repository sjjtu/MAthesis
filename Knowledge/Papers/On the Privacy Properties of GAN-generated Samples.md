## Summary
- vanilla GANs exihibit some weak privacy guarantee, but not enough
- we need to add privacy techniques like DP-SGD or PATE
- "Note that ensuring the privacy for releasing generated samples is a weaker condition than ensuring the privacy for releasing parameters because of the post-processing property of differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2014). Releasing generated samples (versus model parameters) is therefore a promising solution for achieving better privacy-fidelity trade-offs"2
