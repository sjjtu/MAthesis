## Summary
- Authors introduce differentially private SGD
- track privacy loss using moments of privacy loss
- test on MNIST and CIFAR
## Background
- summary of DP properties:
	- Composability: enable modular design of mechanisms
	- Group privacy: graceful degradation of privacy guarantees if dataset contains correlated input, e. g. records from same person
	- Robustness to auxiliary information: privacy guarantees are not affected by any side information

## DPSGD
steps:
	1. compute gradient for random subset of examples
	2. clip $l_2$ norm of gradient and average
	3. add noise to protect privacy
	4. keep track of privacy loss
