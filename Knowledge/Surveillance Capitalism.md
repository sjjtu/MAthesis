a new economic system, which
pursues the exploitation and control of human nature, thereby
threatening our social fabric.


*S. Zuboff: By providing free services that billions
of people cheerfully use, it enables companies
like Google, Facebook, Amazon, ... not only to
monitor the behavior of those users in astonishing
detail - often without their explicit consent.
Our means of social participation have been
conflated with the means through which
surveillance capitalists collect their data and seek
to modify our behavior.
... with disastrous consequences for democracy
and freedom!
