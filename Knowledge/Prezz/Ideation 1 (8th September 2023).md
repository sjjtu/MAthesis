## Motivation to Synthetic Data

- [ MIT Tech' Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045416/10-breakthrough-technologies-2022/#synthetic-data-for-ai) (2022): *" ... Breakthrough Technology ... "*
- [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-06-22-is-synthetic-data-the-future-of-ai) (2022): *" ... estimates that by 2030, synthetic data will completely overshadow real data in AI models"*

## Syntethic Data (SD)

### Approach 1: Gen AI
- PATE-GAN (2019): uses relaxed version of DP, but achieves state of the art results
### Approach 2: Noise
- Laplacian mechanism: add noise according to laplacian distribution
- interesting paper (2022): superrandom walk

## Differential Privacy (DP)
OG definition by Dwork et al (2006)

## DP + SD = ???

## Brainstorming
