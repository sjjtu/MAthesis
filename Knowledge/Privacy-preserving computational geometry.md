Intersection of [[Secure Multi party computation (MPC)]] and [[Computational Geometry]] 
Classical Problems are: 
- shape intersection
- private point inclusion
Required solution is protocol of information exchange where no additional information is revealed beyond what may be inferred from answer to required question.

*Example*
- Alice has point $a$ and Bob has polygon $B$. They need to determine whether $a$ is in $B$
- Alice has polygon $A$, Bob has polygon $B$. They need to determine whether $A$ and $B$ intersect.
