    In this paper, we investigate the so-called numerical value range of a linear, bounded operator in a Hilbert space. Similar to the spectrum of an operator, the numerical range of values helps to determine certain properties of the corresponding operator to be investigated. In doing so, we will often encounter relations between there two invariants. The main objective of this section is the so-called Power Inequality, a statement about the numerical radius of powers of an operator, as well as the norm property of the numerical radius. In particular, an algorithm is presented and implemented, which numerically approximates the numerical value for a finite-dimensional operator. In the final chapter of the thesis, an application of the numerical value range in numerical mathematics is considered.
