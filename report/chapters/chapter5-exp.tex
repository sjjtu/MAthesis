\section{Experiment}
In this chapter we describe the experiments conducted on heartbeat data taken from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data set. Afterwards we present the results and draw insights. The aim is to assess the utility of synthetic data generated by the two algorithms mentioned in chapter \ref{chapter4}. The utility is measured in the downstream task of arrhythmia detection. We are testing differentially private and non-private versions of the models and compare them to baseline model that is trained on the original data.
