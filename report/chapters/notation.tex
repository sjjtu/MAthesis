\section*{Notation}
Mathematical conventions and notation used in this thesis:

\begin{center}
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
    \begin{tabular}{ c l }
        
        $\mathbb{R}$ & the real numbers \\
        $\sqcup$ & disjoint set union \\
        $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ & Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Additionally, we introduce the following conventions to describe various elements from different mathematical objects to make the notations and their meaning as consistent as possible:

\begin{center}
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
    \begin{tabular}{c l}
        $\mathcal{S}$ & set of heartbeat samples \\
        $s_i \in \mathbb{R}^L$ & seqeunce of ECG measurements \\
        $\mathcal{K}^X$ & arrhythmia detection model trained on some training data $X$


    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
